The pre-test is recorded while the subject is watching an EdPuzzle video and answering 5 questions throughout the video. Then, the subject did 10 minutes exercise. The post-test is recorded while the subject is watching another EdPuzzle video and answering 5 questions throughout the video after they have exercised for 10 minutes. 
The subjects’ age range is from 8-16 years, both male and female. I've attached the demographics for you, but I can break it down with specific numbers if that makes it easier. 
There were some points when not all the channels were on at the same time. I'm not sure at what point it occurred in the recording, but I know it didn't happen with every subject. I know that after exercising, some of the kids were sweating, which may have interfered with the sensors. Additionally, as you see on our demographics we had both girls and boys. The most of the girls had long hair and boys had short hair which may also effect the sensors’ recording ability.
